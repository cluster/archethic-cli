# archethic-cli
Archethic Command Line Interpreter


# Doc Archethic TUI

## Main menu
To launch the archetic with a TUI (terminal user interface), you need to pass the `--ui` flag.
When launching the Archethic TUI you will access to the main menu that allows you to select an action. 
- Generate an address
- Build and send a transaction
- Manage keychains (and send transaction keychains)

![Main CLI](docs/img/main-cli.png)

## Generate address
This generate address page allows you to get the address for a given seed, a specific index and with a given elliptic curve and hash algorithm. The default values are probably fine for elliptic curve and hash algorithm.
![Generate address](docs/img/generate_address.png)

## Build and send transaction
This menu allows you to create a transaction. There are 7 tabs you can navigate to, by using the left and right arrows of your keyboard in order to configure your transaction.
### Main tab
This is where you set the main info (like the endpoint, the seed, the transaction type…) and send the transaction. By selecting one of the default node endpoint you will have the URL to send your transaction automatically set. You will need to enter your seed. The index of the transaction will be set automatically (based on the index of the last transaction). Select one of the transaction type, regarding the type you select, you might have specific information to provide to your transaction (for example a transaction of type  `Transfer` needs a UCO transfer or a token transfer. The `Add` buttons sends the transaction and the `Reset` button clears the form.
![Main tab](docs/img/main_tab.png)

### UCO transfers
This tab allows you to create UCO transfers in your transaction. Type a valid address and an amount and press the `Add` button. 
![UCO transfer tab](docs/img/uco_transfers.png)

You will then have a list of configured UCO transfers. Using the up and down keys, you can highlight a configured transfer and delete it by typing `d`.

![UCO transfer tab 2](docs/img/uco_transfers_2.png)

### Token transfers
The same logic applies to the token transfers tab. But you need to specify a token address and an token id.
![Token transfers tab](docs/img/token_transfers.png)

### Recipients
The same logic also applies to the recipients tab.
![Recipients tab](docs/img/recipients.png)

### Ownerships
The ownership tab contains the information about the access you give to execute your transaction. This will be needed if you want to send a smart contract.
You can define several ownerships. Each ownership has a secret and can have a list of authorization keys that get access to the secret. At least one of the ownership must have the seed as a secret and the storage nouce public key as an authorization key.  You can press the `Load Storage Nounce Public Key` to automatically set the authorization key with the value of the storage nounce public key. NB: you must have selected an endpoint in the main tab in order to load the storage nounce public key of the network you target.
![Ownerships tab](docs/img/ownerships.png)

![Ownerhips tab 2](docs/img/ownerships_2.png)
Pressing the `Add authorization key` allows you to add a new authorization key that will get access to the secret. Once added to the list of autorized keys, you can highlight a key and press `d` to delete it. 
Once you’re done with the configuration, you can press the `Add` button to add the ownership configuration to the transaction.
![Ownerships tab 3](docs/img/ownerships_3.png)
And here also, if you want to delete a configured ownership, you can highlight it and press `d`.

### Content
The content tab allows you to set the content of the transaction. Start typing to enter the edit mode of this tab and press `esc` if you want to exit the edit mode and navigate to another tab.
![Content tab](docs/img/content.png)

### Smart contract
The smart contract tab allows you to set the smart contract of the transaction. Start typing to enter the edit mode of this tab and press `esc` if you want to exit the edit mode and navigate to another tab.

![Smart contract tab](docs/img/smart_contract.png)

### Sending the transaction
When you’re done configuring the transaction, go back to the main tab and press the `Add` button.
![Sending transaction](docs/img/sending_transaction.png)

## Keychain management
The keychain management menu allows you to 
- create a keychain with a given seed
- access a keychain
- add and remove services from a keychain
- send a keychain transaction for a specific service

In any cases you will need to start by selecting the endpoint you want, that will automatically feed the URL of the endpoint. 
Then specify your access seed.

![Keychain management](docs/img/keychain_management.png)

### Creating a keychain
If you press the `Create keychain` button, a new keychain will be created. And the seed you provided will be used to access it. 

![Create a keychain](docs/img/create_keychain.png)

### Accessing a keychain
Pressing the `Access keychain` button will give you access to the list of services associated with your keychain (one default `uco` service has been created).
![Access a keychain](docs/img/access_keychain.png)

### Adding / removing a service
If you go down to the `service name` field you can type a new service name and a default derivation path will be created. If you then press the `Create Service`, your new service will be displayed in the list of services.
![Add a service](docs/img/add_service.png)
If you highlight a service and press `d` the service will be deleted.

### Create a transaction for a service
If you highlight a specific service and press `enter` the highlighted will be selected.
![Create a transaction for a service](docs/img/create_keychain_transaction.png)

If you then press the `Create Transaction for Service` button, you will get a new menu to create a transaction for the selected service.

![Main tab of create keychain transaction](docs/img/main_keychain_transaction.png)
The mechanism to configure a keychain transaction for a service is the same as the one for a transaction (described above). Only a few configuration are not possible (like the endpoint, the seed, the index and the elliptic curve).

# Archethic CLI
It is also possible to call the archethic cli tool using the command line.

## Generate address
`generate-address`Get the address of a transaction based on parameters
### Params
- `--seed`  (string) the seed
- `--index` (integer) index of the transaction
- `--hash-algorithm`  (SHA256|SHA512|SHA3_256|SHA3_512|BLAKE2B) the hash algorithm. Default value is `SHA256`
- `--elliptic-curve` (ED25519|P256|SECP256K1) the elliptic curve. The default value is `ED25519`

## Send transaction
`send-transaction`
Send a transaction. It’s also possible to send a transaction for a specific service of a keychain (by passing the service parameter). You can either pass the parameter as flags in the command line or decide to put the parameters in a YAML file and pass the path of the config file using the `config` flag.
### Command line params
- `--config` (string) the path of the yaml configuration file (see below for the explanation of the parameters), if the config flag is passed, the other flags will be ignored for the configuration of the transaction
- `--endpoint`  (local|testnet|mainnet|[custom url]) the endpoint to use, you can write your own URL. Default value is `local`.
- `--access-seed`(string) the access seed
- `--index` (integer) the index of the new transaction
- `--elliptic-curve` (ED25519|P256|SECP256K1) the elliptic curve. The default value is `ED25519`
- `transaction-type`  (keychain_access|keychain|transfer|hosting|token|data|contract|code_proposal|code_approval) the transaction type. The default value is `transfer`.
- `--uco-transfers` (destinationAddress(string)=amount(integer)) the UCO transfers. You can create several UCO transfers in a transaction by passing the `uco-transfers` flag several times. The amount passed will be multiplied by 10^8.
- `--token-transfers`  (to(string)=amount(integer),token_address(string),token_id(integer)) the token transfers. You can create several token transfers in a transaction by passing the `token-transfers` flag several times. The amount passed will be multiplied by 10^8.
- `--recipients` (string) the recipients. You can create several recipients in a transaction by passing the `recipients` flag several times. 
- `--ownerships` (secret(string)=authorization_key(string)) the ownerships. You can create several ownerships in a transaction by passing the `ownerships` flag several times. In the sent transaction, the ownerships will be grouped by `secret`.
- `--content` (string) the path of the file containing the `content` of the transaction.
- `--smart-contract` (string) the path of the file containing the `smart-contract` of the transaction.
- `--serviceName` (string) the name of the service of the keychain you want to use to create the transaction
### YAML configuration file
The parameters you can use in the YAML file are basically the same, only the format of the `ownerships`, `recipients`, `token-transfers` and `uco-transfers` changes. Also, regarding the `smart-contract`
and the `content` parameters, it is the value of the param that is passed (not the path of the file containing the value).
